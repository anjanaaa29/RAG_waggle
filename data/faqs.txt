Pet Monitor FAQ
Most Popular
1. Where do I install the monitor for optimal Cellular / GPS signal reception?
Install the monitor in an open area inside your RV, car, or home — ideally near a window or where it has a clear line of sight to the outdoors/sky but not directly facing sunlight. Avoid placing it inside enclosed compartments/closets or behind metal surfaces, as these can interfere with cellular signal reception and may also cause temperature errors. Also please make sure the pet monitor front face ( where the temperature sensor is located ) is not directly facing sunlight to avoid false high temperature alerts.
2. How do I install the monitor for accurate temperature readings?
Install the monitor in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight, vents, or heating/cooling sources. Placing it near air conditioners, heaters, or windows exposed to sunlight may cause temperature readings to be inaccurate and may accumulate dust/lint in the sensor cavity on the pet monitor and result in inaccurate readings.
3. Can I use any USB cable/adapter to charge the product?
For best performance and safety, we recommend using only the USB cable and adapter provided with your Waggle Pet Monitor. Using other USB or incompatible or low-power chargers/poor cables may result in slower charging or product malfunction. Waggle guarantees performance only when used with the supplied accessories and the product warranty becomes void due to damages caused by third party accessories including chargers/cables.
4. Why is my pet monitor showing a different temperature compared to another thermometer or my thermostat?
Waggle Pet monitor uses a high-quality Swiss made temperature & humidity sensor and every Waggle Pet monitor is factory calibrated to  +/- 1 Deg C (+/- 2 Deg F ) accuracy referenced to NIST. Thermostats vary widely in terms of temperature accuracy and temperature errors of more than +/- 2F are common.  The other common reasons for the difference between your thermostat and the pet monitor reading maybe they are located at different areas of the room. For a fair comparison, ensure both are placed next to each other and even then, there may be a difference of 4F or more based on the quality/accuracy of the reference meter.
5. Why does my monitor not get any signal even though my cell phone has coverage?
Though today's cell phones also use the 4G cellular signals, they are of a different variety and frequency than the one used by Waggle pet monitor. Waggle pet monitor uses 4G CatM1 while cellphones use 4G Cat4 or higher. While most of the times, a given location would have both signals available, there are locations, where your cell phone 4G signal maybe available, but the 4G catM1 signal may not be available or poor.  If this happens, try relocating the pet monitor closer to a window or door and ensure there are no obstructions and reset/restart the monitor.  This should most likely resolve the issue. If it persists please contact our support team and they can help with other options.

When your RV moves out of the geofence, you’ll receive an OUT alert once. When your RV enters back to your geofence zone, you’ll receive an IN alert once.
Note:
If you want to pin another geofence zone in another location, you have to re-center the current geofence.

13. What is the frequency of Temperature Alerts?
Waggle Pet Monitor alerts you once the temperature exceeds the set limit. Once a Temperature Alert is triggered, you get reminders every 60 minutes by default until the temperature goes back to the set range.
Users can customize the alert interval from 30 minutes.The change in the frequency will be updated on your next report interval.
14. What is the frequency of Power Loss Alerts?
Waggle Pet Monitor sends you instant alerts when there is an RV power loss.
Once the Power Loss Alert is triggered, you will get reminders every 60 minutes by default until the Waggle Pet Monitor returns to power mode.
Users can customize the alert interval to as little as 30 minutes.
The change in the frequency will be updated on your next report interval.
15. Does a Verizon signal booster improve the coverage of Waggle Pet Monitor?
No. Waggle Pet Monitors use Verizon 4G-CatM1, a special version of Verizon 4G meant for wireless sensors.
Verizon's nationwide 4G-CatM1 coverage is similar to 4G, but the signal strength may differ from common 4G signals.
Regular cell boosters only improve the coverage of 4G signals, not 4G-CatM1.
16. Is the Waggle Pet Monitor battery operated?
Yes, the Waggle Pet Monitor is battery-operated. It is made of a rechargeable Li-ion battery (commonly used in cell phones).
The device can be charged using a micro-USB cable through any USB plug point, power bank, or 12V input and 5V output car charger.
17. Can I charge the Waggle Pet Monitor using my car charger?
Yes. You can charge the Waggle Pet Monitor using a 12V input and 5V output Car charger.
18. What is the battery life of Waggle Pet Monitor?
Waggle Pet Monitor Lite and PRO can last up to 4 to 6 days on battery, depending on network availability and alert frequency. To enhance battery life,
always keep it powered. For the PRO+Air model, we recommend continuous power use, though it has a 24-hour battery backup.
Note:

Yes, the device has a customizable low battery alert to notify users when the battery level drops below the pre-determined threshold.

The heat index formula is expressed as: makefile
HI = c1 + c2T + c3R + c4TR + c5T2 + c6R2 + c7T2R + c8TR2 + c9T2R2
In this formula,
HI = heat index in degrees Fahrenheit,
R = Relative humidity,
T = Temperature in ∘F,
c1 = -42.379,
c2= -2.04901523,
c3 = -10.14333127,
c4 = -0.22475541,
c5 = -6.83783 x 10−3,
c6 = -5.481717 x 10−2,
c7 = -1.22874 x 10−3,
c8 = 8.5282 x 10−4,
c9 = -1.99 x 10−6
